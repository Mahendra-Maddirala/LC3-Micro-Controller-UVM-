# This file defines all of the 'utility components' for the possible example YAML
# example configurations. In general, these are predictors of various types, although
# a type of 'coverage' is also supported. All utility components can contain any number
# of analysis exports and analysis imports, each with a unique name and defined type.
# The user will be responsible for filling out the internals of a predictor and 
# producing write() calls on the analysis ports. For a coverage component the user will
# need to define meaningful functional coverage content.

# It is possible that the type of an analsyis port or export will be a parameterized
# class. Be aware that type mismatches between the port type defined here and the connected
# port could occur; the generator script does not carry out any checking at that level.
